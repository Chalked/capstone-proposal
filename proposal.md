# Capstone Proposal

### Project Description

When Bitcoin passed the $20,000 mark last year, many people who didn't invest felt they had missed the boat (I know I did!). I found myself wishing that I could experiment with investing in cryptocurrency, but I didn't have the money. Even if I did have the money, I'm not in a position to risk losing it. 

But what if I could experiment with crypto investments, sans risk and money? That's where Fantasy Crypto Investor comes in. Fantasy Crypto Investor is an application that allows the user to experience risk-free crypto investment in a realistic environment, all from their mobile device.

### Problem Statement

As Cryptocurrency gains popularity, there are more and more people who are curious about investing. However, the risk associated with any investment (and especially an investment that isn't publically trusted) prevents many from doing so. If people were able to invest in crypto without the risk, it would help educate people about cryptocurrency as well as help usher in public trust.    

### How will your project solve this problem? 

Fantasy Crypto Investor is an iOS application that simulates a real-world environment and allows the user to to experience investing money in crypto assets without any of the associated risk. 

### Map the user experience

Tony has downloaded Fantasy Crypto Investor for his iPhone. Upon opening the app, it asks him to sign in via facebook. Once he does, he sees a screen asking him which currencies he would like to track. The currencies he chooses will be saved to his profile and will remain there whenever he opens the app. 

Tony wants to invest in some crypto assets, so he opens the app. Upon creating a profile, the app provides each user with $100,000 worth of credits, which can be invested as user sees fit. Tony decides to invest $50,000 in Bitcoin. His profile now shows his investment of $50,000 in Bitcoin, and will go up or down depending on the actual market value of the asset. 

After making over $15,000 from his investment in Bitcoin, Tony wants to invest $30,000 in Ethereum. Using the app, he makes the transaction, leaving him with $20,000 in credits left over, his $30,000 investment in Ethereum, and the $65,000 he still has invested in Bitcoin. 

After losing $5,000 on his investment in Ethereum, Tony wants to pull his money out. So, he initiates a transaction, and the remaining $25,000 is transferred back into credits.
